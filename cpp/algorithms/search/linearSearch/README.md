# Linear Search

Probably the easiest search algorithm to implement.
Works with sorted and unsorted arrays of integers.
It is 1 loop with 1 condition, iterates over all elements of the array and compares the current element with the target number.
Returns the index of the number in the array if it was found, *otherwise returns -1*;

## Algorithm
- Iterate over the array
- If the number is found, return its **index**, otherwise **return -1**
